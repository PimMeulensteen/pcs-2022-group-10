Run the simulation with
```bash
    python3 simulation.py
```

Note: the simulation can be stopped when desired by closing the simulation window. A pollution map is automatically created in the figure pollution.png

Run
```bash
python3 experiment.py lights
```
to run an experiment that determines the CO2 emission per car for varying traffic light durations (time lights are green before turning red).

Run
```bash
python3 experiment.py traffic
```
to run an experiment that determines the CO2 emission per car for varying levels of business at the intersection (thus the expected number of cars per second).

Both experiments take approximately 5 minutes.
